## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- - Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

I learnt more about css buttons especially applying shadow to a button


```css
.button-shadow {
  box-shadow: 0 1rem 1.5rem hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
}
```

### Continued development

My continue development will be on CSS. I'd do more projects/challenges
